		<h1>About Me </h1>
		<p>My name is Nur Nadhirah Mustapha and I am a second-year student in Bachelor of Netcentric Computing, UiTM Shah Alam. 
		To simply describe myself, I am an competitive person and I enjoy using my passion to contribute to the exciting challenges that I will probably face in future. I took Foundation in Science and I know I should be taking medicine studies but I only plan, Allah decides.
        By the way, please looking forward to my first ever website using HTML and CSS :) </p>

				<h2>Always see the best and be grateful. </h2>

					<p class="solid">Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Look at those who are beneath you and do not look at those who are above you, for it is more suitable that you should not consider as less the blessing of Allah.” [Ibn Majah]</p>
					<br><p>Yes, I know our hearts have been used several times, crushed in the most heartless ways but you know what? Our behavior should only increase in love and positivity, 
					not because we will appear to be beautiful to others but because Allah swt sees it all. Because only He will know how much we have been through and we are still 
					keeping our heads up and spreading goodness. This is not easy but it is also not impossible. You have the ability to control your whims or let your heart become its slave.</p>

				<h2>Family is not an important thing. It's everything. </h2>
					<p> I have total six siblings and currently, there are fourteen amazing people in my family. Ehem, two of them are already married and they both are blessed with a child, so my parents have two grandchild now. In the picture, four were missing. Three of them went to their in-laws while another one had to work durign Eid. Despite that, we still celebrate Eid together and this year is actually our first time celebrating Eid in our house, and not in grandma's house.
						My policy in life is family is my first priority. They are my home, my best friends and laughing place.</p>
